When using Sheety, your request body must match the exact schema it generates based on your sheet name â€”
singular, not plural.

If your sheet is named: workouts


Sheety will generate an endpoint path like:

https://api.sheety.co/your-id/myWorkouts/workouts


But for the POST request payload, Sheety expects a singular key:

{
  "workout": {
    "date": "24/08/2025",
    "time": "12:34:56",
    "exercise": "Running",
    "duration": 30,
    "calories": 250
  }
}
