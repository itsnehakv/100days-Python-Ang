## Learning Python by Building Project
TBAðŸ¥²<br><br>
This repository contains my solutions and projects from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) on ![Udemy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udemy-A435F0?style=for-the-badge&logo=Udemy&logoColor=white)

â€¢ This repository showcases my consistent learning efforts and reflects my dedication to mastering Python through hands-on, real-world projects. It highlights not only the technical skills I've developed, but also the discipline and curiosity that drive my growth as a developer.
<br>
â€¢ In addition to learning Python, this journey also helped me become comfortable with using Git and GitHub â€” including version control, branching and committing.
  
## ðŸ§­ Why I Started This Challenge

- ðŸš€ To build a solid Python foundation from scratch
- ðŸ§  To understand core programming concepts and real-world applications
- âŒ› To dedicate focused time (100 days) to consistent skill development
- ðŸ“‚ To document my growth and share my work publicly
 <br>


 ## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered So Far
 <br>

I'm documenting my progress and learning journey as I go through each day of the course. The goal is to build 100 Python projects in 100 days, ranging from beginner to advanced level.
